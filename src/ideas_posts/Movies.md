title: Movie Score Web Scraper
description: With this application, I want to make a webscraper that grabs every movie score from every big movie critic brand (Rotton Tomatoes, IMDB, Letterboxd, Metacritic, etc.) and compiles a total score. Users will also be able to see all of the scores all in one place in order to find the movie they want to watch! Maybe there could be a way to include the opinions of smaller but highly praised critics as well.
