title: STICKY - Sticky Note Based Notes/TODO App
description: This platform would be a new notes app organized into sticky notes where related notes would go onto the same sticky note. That being said, related sticky notes could be sorted into groups. For example, a student could have a sticky note for each class and all the classes would be a group. Then, they could have a school group, personal group, etc. At the same time, every note associated with a date becomes a TODO! It's that simple! I imgine a really intuitive "flowy" UI where users can drag around sitcky notes throughout different groups and the other sticky notes would adjust accordingly. It's important to note that when I write "notes" I mean little reminders not classnotes per say.
