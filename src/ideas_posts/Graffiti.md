title: Local Graffiti Game/Documentation
description: Growing up in Chicago, I've always loved looking at graffiti, but outside of major cities, local graffiti isn't documented or even explored. What if there was a web application that documented all local graffiti pieces. It could show a map of the area, and point to the art in the area. Users would be able to sort by artist, location, size, and even report pieces that aren't on the platform. There could also be a cool extension where the platform doesn't show the exact location of the graffiti, but instead shows the general area (block) and users would have to go and seek out the art as a game! They could then check off the art in the app.
